**Version 1:**

At first the game didn't had any distinctive are art , I just used the assets I created for my old games.

I used the flappy bird Background image for the background and just placed the Label node on top of it.

Couldn't get  a screen shot on run time , Because I have already made changes on by the time of updating this Documentation.

**Version 2:**

  Then I created a Clicker sprite and inserted the Label node inside the Clicker sprite as a child and placed it conveniently inside it.
