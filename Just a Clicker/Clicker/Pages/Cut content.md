1. Story:
	I wanted to implement story to game which goes like this:
	  A man and a woman living together(intentionally wanted them not to be married in order to create a mystery around them). The woman left him at his home in the morning saying that she will be back home as soon as she got rid of the issue they are into.
	  Then the game starts and he is up to interact with various things and clues about what happened in home.
	  I wanted to make the narrative as a murder mystery story but dropped the idea because the game already took way too much time than I initially expected and I just wanted to get rid of the game as soon as possible.
	  ![[Pasted image 20250120132802.png]] Created a text box for the game, but never actually used it

2. Interiors:
	The game was planned to have excessive amount of interactable. 
	The art of the game is created in such a way that the game takes place at a roof top but I initially wanted to allow the players to get downstairs and interact with the props which will give some information and leads to what happened.
	But these ideas where dropped as they were way too ambitious and I am really bad at art.

3. Miscellaneous:
	Wanted to add options menu in the game's pause menu and main menu but as I was clearly not able understand and it was way less worthy for the amount of hassles I have to go through.
